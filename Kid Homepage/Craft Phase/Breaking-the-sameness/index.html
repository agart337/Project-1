            <p>There are times during the Craft phase when you hit a wall. Before stepping away, it’s worth finding
                ways to break the sameness and refresh your excitement.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Small Steps</h2>
            <p>A blocked musician was asked to write one line daily. The quality didn’t matter—just the commitment.
                This small task reopened the creative channel, leading to full compositions faster than expected.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Change the Environment</h2>
            <p>Altering an element of the setting can shift consciousness. Turning off lights, changing the time of
                recording, or even hanging upside down while singing have produced new variations in performance.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Change the Stakes</h2>
            <p>Modifying internal stakes can impact performance. A band imagining it’s their last time playing a song
                may perform it differently. Conversely, lowering stakes with a rehearsal before recording can also
                improve results.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Invite an Audience</h2>
            <p>Being observed changes how an artist performs. Even one outsider can sharpen focus. This applies beyond
                music—writing or cooking may also shift with an audience present.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Change the Context</h2>
            <p>If a singer lacks connection to a song, reinterpreting its meaning can help. A love song might take on
                new depth when sung as a devotion to God. Experimenting with different perspectives can enhance
                performance.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Alter the Perspective</h2>
            <p>Adjusting volume in headphones changes dynamics. Louder playback leads to quieter performances, while
                lowering vocal volume can encourage stronger delivery. In concerts, altering lighting or in-ear monitor
                settings influences engagement.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Write for Someone Else</h2>
            <p>Imagining writing for a favorite artist can remove self-imposed limitations. Choosing an artist with a
                contrasting style can prevent creative stagnation.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Add Imagery</h2>
            <p>Describing a vivid scene before performing can shape musical expression. A keyboard solo improved when
                framed as the aftermath of a battle. Even without clear connections, imagery can strengthen direction.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Limit the Information</h2>
            <p>To avoid musicians being influenced by a demo, only basic elements like chords are shared. This allows
                them to interpret freely, leading to more original results.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>These exercises are flexible. The goal is to shift perspectives, explore new approaches, and push beyond
                familiar creative methods.</p>
