            <br>
            <p>Art is about the maker, an expression of who we are. Competition is absurd because every artist’s work is
                unique to them. Art cannot be measured against another; it reflects the individual and their cultural
                contribution.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some believe competition inspires greatness, pushing creative limits. However, competition often
                operates at a lower energy. Creating to outperform others rarely results in true greatness or a healthy
                mindset. Comparison steals joy. Why create to diminish someone else?
                <br>
                <br>
                When inspired by great work, the energy shifts. Seeing the bar raised can encourage us to reach higher.
                This rising-to-meet energy differs from conquering.
                <br>
                <br>
                Brian Wilson heard Rubber Soul and was inspired to write God Only Knows. Paul McCartney then heard Pet
                Sounds and, deeply moved, helped create Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Their creative exchange
                wasn’t commercial competition but mutual love, benefiting us all.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our ability and taste may evolve, yielding different works over time, but none can be evaluated as more
                or less than another. They are different snapshots of who we are, and who we were.

                <br>
                <br>
                They are all our best work in the moment they were created.

                <br>
                <br>
                With each new project, we are challenging ourselves to most beautifully reflect what’s living in us at
                that particular window of time.

                <br>
                <br>
                In this spirit of self-competition, task yourself to go further and push into the unexpected. Don’t stop
                even at greatness. Venture beyond.
