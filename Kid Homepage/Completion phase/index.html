            <p>Rubin counsels artists to battle against the drive to perfection: “When you believe the work before you
                is the single piece that will forever define you, it’s difficult to let it go.” But after this work is
                another—a fresh chance to see what you can make. “In the end, you are the only one who has to love it.
                This work is for you.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Rubin notes that these stages might not always be linear. Some projects will require you to go back to
                the Experimentation phase if you discover during the Craft or Completion stage that something isn’t
                working. He cautions, however, that artists need to be wary of returning to an earlier stage not because
                the project needs it but because they want to experience that same kind of energy again. If this is the
                case, it’s better to start experimenting with a new project in tandem with crafting or completing work
                on your original project.
