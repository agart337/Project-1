            <p>The artist’s job is never truly finished. Unlike other occupations, the artist is always on call, even
                after stepping away from their craft.
                <br>
                <br>
                The artist’s work consists of two kinds:
                <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The work of doing.</li>
                <li> The work of being.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Creativity is not just an action but a way of life. If you're not driven by an extreme dedication, this
                path may not be for you. The irony is that while an artist seeks balance, this way of life allows little
                room for it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once you commit to the creative life, it becomes part of you. Even during a project, you continuously
                seek new ideas. At any moment, you're ready to capture a fleeting thought. This process becomes second
                nature, present in every hour of the day.
                <br>
                <br>
                Staying in it requires openness—paying attention, listening, finding connections, seeking beauty, and
                noticing what draws your interest. All of this becomes raw material for your work.
                <br>
                <br>
                There’s no predicting where the next idea will come from. Like a surfer at the mercy of the waves,
                artists must stay aware and present, watching and waiting.
                <br>

                Maybe the best idea
