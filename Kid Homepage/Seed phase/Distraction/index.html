                Distraction, when used skillfully, is a valuable tool for artists and sometimes the only way forward.
                <br>
                <br>
                In meditation, the mind can be overtaken by worries or random thoughts. Many meditation schools teach
                mantras—automatic, repeated phrases—to prevent this. Mantras act as distractions that keep the conscious
                mind busy, freeing the unconscious to work. Worry beads, rosaries, and malas serve the same function.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the creative process, stepping away from a project can create space for solutions to emerge. Holding
                a problem lightly in the back of our consciousness while engaging in simple, repetitive tasks—like
                driving, walking, swimming, or showering—can help. Physical movement may also spur ideas.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some musicians, for example, find melodies more easily while driving than when consciously trying to
                compose. These distractions keep part of the mind occupied, allowing the rest to remain open to new
                ideas. This process of “nonthinking thought” may engage a different part of the brain, one that
                perceives more angles than a direct approach.
                <br>
                <br>
                Distraction is not procrastination. While procrastination undermines creativity, distraction is a
                strategy that serves the work.

                Sometimes disengaging
