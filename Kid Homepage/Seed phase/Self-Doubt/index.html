                Self-doubt exists in all of us and serves a purpose. Our imperfections make us and our work unique. If
                insecurity is part of who we are, it adds truth to our creations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Art is not a competition; it represents the self. If you feel unprepared, only you can bring your vision
                to life. Many artists are vulnerable, and some struggle to hear their own voice. The same sensitivity
                that fuels creativity also makes artists susceptible to judgment, yet they continue because
                self-expression defines them.
                <br>
                <br>
                If fear of judgment prevents creation, the desire to share may not outweigh the need for protection. Art
                isn’t for everyone, and adversity is part of the process. Having talent doesn’t obligate us to
                create—it’s a privilege, not a duty.
                <br>
                <br>
                Many successful artists battle insecurity, addiction, and personal struggles, which can inspire art but
                also hinder longevity. Some create great work only once or twice because their challenges prevent
                sustained creativity. Many artists who die young from overdoses use drugs to numb their sensitivity—the
                very trait that makes them artists.
                <br>
                <br>
                Seeing beauty or pain where others see nothing brings intense emotions, leading to isolation and
                otherness. These feelings fuel art but can also overwhelm, creating a need to numb the pain just to
                function. It’s both a blessing and a curse.
