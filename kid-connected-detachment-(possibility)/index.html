            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Consider detaching from the story of your life as it’s happening.
                <br>
                <br>
                The manuscript of your novel is lost in a fire. Your romantic relationship ends unexpectedly. You lose a
                job you care about. As hard as it may seem, experience these events as if watching a movie. The
                protagonist faces a seemingly insurmountable challenge.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s you, but it’s not you.
                <br>
                <br>
                Instead of sinking into heartbreak, stress, or grief, practicing detachment might lead to: I wasn’t
                expecting that plot twist. I wonder what’s going to happen to our hero next.
                <br>
                <br>
                There’s always a next scene, which may bring beauty and fulfillment. Hard times set the stage for new
                possibilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                The outcome is not the outcome. Darkness is not an end, nor is daylight. They exist in a continually
                unfolding, mutually dependent cycle—neither bad nor good.
                <br>
                <br>
                This practice—never assuming an experience is the whole story—supports open possibility and equanimity.
                When we fixate on events, they may appear catastrophic, but they are just small aspects of a larger
                life. Zoom in and obsess. Zoom out and observe. We get to choose.
                <br>
                <br>
                At an impasse, hopelessness may arise. The ability to step back and see new pathways will be invaluable.
                <br>
                <br>
                If we embrace this principle, imagination frees us from personal and cultural narratives. Art has the
                power to snap us out of transfixion, open our minds to possibilities, and reconnect us with the eternal
                energy moving through all things.
