                        <p>The artist’s job is never truly finished.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In many occupations, when we go home, we leave our work behind at the office. The artist
                                is always on
                                call. Even after we get up from hours engaged in our craft, the clock is still running.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This is because the artist’s job is of two kinds:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The work of doing.
                                <br>
                                The work of being.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Creativity is something you are, not only something you do. It’s a way of
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                moving through the world, every minute, every day. If you’re not driven to an
                                unrealistic standard of
                                dedication, it may not be the path for you. So much of the artist’s work is about
                                balance, so it’s
                                ironic that this way of life leaves little room for it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Once you acquiesce to the demands of the creative life, it becomes a part of you. Even
                                in the midst of a
                                project, you still look for new ideas each day. At any moment, you’re prepared to stop
                                what you’re doing
                                to make a note or a drawing, or capture a fleeting thought. It becomes second nature.
                                And we’re always
                                in it, every hour of the day.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Staying in it means a commitment to remain open to what’s around you. Paying attention
                                and listening.
                                Looking for connections and relationships in the outside world. Searching for beauty.
                                Seeking stories.
                                Noticing what you find interesting, what makes you lean forward. And knowing all of this
                                is available to
                                use next time you sit down to work, where the raw data gets put into form.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There is no telling where that next great story, painting, recipe, or business idea is
                                going to come
                                from. Just as a surfer can’t control the waves, artists are at the mercy of the creative
                                rhythms of
                                nature. This is why it’s of such great importance to remain aware and present at all
                                times. Watching and
                                waiting.
