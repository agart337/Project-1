                        <br>
                        <p>Distraction is one of the best tools available to the artist when used skillfully. In some
                                cases, itâ€™s
                                the only way to get where we are going.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When meditating, as soon as the mind quiets, the sense of space can be overtaken by a
                                worry or a random
                                thought. This is why many meditation schools teach students to use a mantra. An
                                automatic, repeated
                                phrase leaves little room in the mind for thoughts that pull us out of the moment.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The mantra, then, is a distraction. And while certain distractions can take you out of
                                the present
                                moment, others can keep the conscious part of yourself busy so that the unconscious is
                                freed up to work
                                for you. Worry beads, rosaries, and malas work in the same way.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When we reach an impasse at any point in the creative process, it can be helpful to step
                                away from the
                                project to create space and allow a solution to appear.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We might hold a problem to be solved lightly in the back of our consciousness instead of
                                the front of
                                our mind. This way, we can remain present with it over time while engaging in a simple,
                                unrelated task.
                                Examples include driving, walking, swimming, showering, washing dishes, dancing, or
                                performing any
                                activity we can accomplish on autopilot. At times, physical movement can spur ideas to
                                move too.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some musicians, for example, do a better job of writing melodies while driving than
                                sitting in a room
                                with an audio recorder on. These types of distractions keep one part of the mind busy
                                while freeing the
                                rest to remain open to whatever comes in. Perhaps this process of nonthinking thought
                                allows us to
                                access a different part of our brain. One that can see more angles than the direct path.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Distraction is not procrastination. Procrastination consistently undermines our ability
                                to make things.
                                Distraction is a strategy in service of the work.
