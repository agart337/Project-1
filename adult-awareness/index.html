                        <br>
                        <p>In most of our daily activities we choose the agenda and develop a strategy to achieve the
                                goal at hand.
                                We create the program.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Awareness moves differently. The program is happening around us. The world is the doer
                                and we are the
                                witness. We have little or no control over the content.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The gift of awareness allows us to notice what’s going on around and inside ourselves in
                                the present
                                moment. And to do so without attachment or involvement. We may observe bodily
                                sensations, passing
                                thoughts and feelings, sounds or visual cues, smells and tastes.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Through detached noticing, awareness allows an observed flower to reveal more of itself
                                without our
                                intervention. This is true of all things.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Awareness is not a state you force. There is little effort involved, though persistence
                                is key. It’s
                                something you actively allow to happen. It is a presence with, and acceptance of, what
                                is happening in
                                the eternal now.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As soon as you label an aspect of Source, you’re no longer noticing, you’re studying.
                                This holds true of
                                any thought that takes you out of presence with the object of your awareness, whether
                                analysis or simply
                                becoming aware that you’re aware. Analysis is a secondary function. The awareness
                                happens first as a
                                pure connection with the object of your attention. If something strikes me as
                                interesting or beautiful,
                                first I live that experience. Only afterward might I attempt to understand it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Though we can’t change what it is that we are noticing, we can change our ability to
                                notice.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We can expand our awareness and narrow it, experience it with our eyes open or closed.
                                We can quiet our
                                inside so we can perceive more on the outside, or quiet the outside so we can notice
                                more of what’s
                                happening inside.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We can zoom in on something so closely it loses the features that make it what it
                                appears to be, or zoom
                                so far out it seems like something entirely new.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The universe is only as large as our perception of it. When we cultivate our awareness,
                                we are expanding
                                the universe.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This expands the scope, not just of the material at our disposal to create from, but of
                                the life we get
                                to live.
                                <br>
