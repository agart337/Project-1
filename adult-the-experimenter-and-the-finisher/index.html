                        <br>
                        <p>In their nature, many artists lean toward one of two categories: Experimenters or Finishers.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Experimenters are partial to dreaming and play, finding it more difficult to complete
                                and release their
                                work.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Finishers are the mirror image, a backward reflection. They move quickly to the end
                                point with immediate
                                clarity. They are less interested in exploring the possibilities and alternatives that
                                the
                                Experimentation and Craft phases can suggest.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Each might find it helpful to borrow from the other.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Finishers might benefit from taking more time in the early phases. Writing beyond the
                                minimum
                                requirement, experimenting with other materials, considerations, and perspectives.
                                Allowing themselves
                                space for improvisation and surprise in the process.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Experimenters might benefit from taking an aspect of the work through to completion. It
                                might be a
                                drawing, a song,or the chapter of a book. Even making one foundational decision from
                                which to build can
                                help.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Take the example of an album. If you’re a musician struggling with ten songs, narrow
                                your focus to two.
                                When we make the task more manageable and focused, a change occurs. And completing even
                                a small segment
                                builds confidence.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Going from two to three is easier than going from zero to two. And if you happen to get
                                stuck on three,
                                then skip it and get four and five done.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Complete as many elements of the project as you can without getting hung up. It’s much
                                easier to circle
                                back once the workload is reduced. Often the knowledge we gain from finishing the other
                                pieces becomes a
                                key to overcoming earlier obstacles.
