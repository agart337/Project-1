                        <p>Art is about the maker.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Its aim: to be an expression of who we are.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This makes competition absurd. Every artist’s playing field is specific to them. You are
                                creating the
                                work that best represents you. Another artist is making the work that best represents
                                them. The two
                                cannot be measured against one another. Art relates to the artist making it, and the
                                unique contribution
                                they are bringing to the culture.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some may argue that competition inspires greatness. The challenge of exceeding what
                                others have
                                accomplished can act as an incentive to push our creative limits. In most cases, though,
                                this energy of
                                competition oscillates at a lower vibration.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Wanting to outperform another artist or make a work better than theirs rarely results in
                                true greatness.
                                Nor is it a mindset that has a healthy impact on the rest of our lives. As Theodore
                                Roosevelt pointed
                                out, comparison is the thief of joy. Besides, why would we want to create with the
                                purpose of
                                diminishing someone else?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When another great work inspires us to elevate our own, however, the energy is
                                different. Seeing the bar
                                raised in our field can encourage us to reach even higher. This energy of rising-to-meet
                                is quite
                                different from that of conquering.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When Brian Wilson first heard the Beatles’ Rubber Soul, his mind was blown. “If I ever
                                do anything in my
                                life, I’m going to make that good an album,” he thought at the time. He went on to
                                explain, “I was so
                                happy to hear it that I went and started writing ‘God Only Knows.’ ”
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Being made happy by someone else’s best work, and then letting it inspire you to rise to
                                the occasion,
                                is not competition. It’s collaboration.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When Paul McCartney heard the resulting Beach Boys album, Pet Sounds, he too was blown
                                away and reduced
                                to tears, proclaiming “God Only Knows” was to his ears the best song ever written.
                                Buoyed by the
                                experience, the Beatles played Pet Sounds over and over while creating another
                                masterpiece, Sgt.
                                Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. “Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper never would have
                                happened,” Beatles
                                producer George Martin said. “Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.”
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This creative back-and-forth wasn’t based on commercial competition, it was based on
                                mutual love. And we
                                are all the beneficiaries of this upward spiral toward magnificence.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                No system exists that can rank which work is most reflective of the maker. Great art is
                                an invitation,
                                calling to creators everywhere to strive for still higher and deeper levels.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There is another type of competitiveness that might be seen as an infinite gain: a story
                                that can
                                continue to unfold over the course of an artist’s life. This is the competition with the
                                self.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Think of self-competition as a quest for evolution. The object is not to beat our other
                                work. It’s to
                                move things forward and create a sense of progression. Growth over superiority.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Our ability and taste may evolve, yielding different works over time, but none can be
                                evaluated as more
                                or less than another. They are different snapshots of who we are, and who we were. They
                                are all our best
                                work in the moment they were created.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                With each new project, we are challenging ourselves to most beautifully reflect what’s
                                living in us at
                                that particular window of time.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In this spirit of self-competition, task yourself to go further and push into the
                                unexpected. Don’t stop
                                even at greatness. Venture beyond.
