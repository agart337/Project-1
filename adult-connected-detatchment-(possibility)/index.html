                        <p>Consider detaching from the story of your life as it’s happening.
                                The manuscript of the novel you’ve worked on for years is lost in a fire. Your romantic
                                relationship
                                breaks up when you thought it was going well. You lose a job you care about. As hard as
                                it may seem,
                                seek to experience events like these as if you’re watching a movie. You’re observing a
                                dramatic scene
                                where the protagonist faces a seemingly insurmountable challenge.
                                It’s you, but it’s not you.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Instead of sinking into the pain of heartbreak or the stress of being laid off or the
                                grief of loss, if
                                practicing detachment the response might be: I wasn’t expecting that plot
                                twist. I wonder what’s going to happen to our hero next.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There’s always a next scene, and that next scene may be one of great beauty and
                                fulfillment. The hard
                                times were the required setup to allow these new possibilities to come into being.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The outcome is not the outcome. The darkness is not an end point, nor is the daylight.
                                They live in a
                                continually unfolding, mutually dependent cycle. Neither is bad or good. They simply
                                exist.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This practice—of never assuming an experience you have is the whole story—will support
                                you in a life of
                                open possibility and equanimity. When we obsessively focus on these events, they may
                                appear
                                catastrophic. But they’re just a small aspect of a larger life, and the further you zoom
                                back, the
                                smaller each experience becomes.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Zoom in and obsess. Zoom out and observe. We get to choose.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When we reach an impasse, we may experience feelings of hopelessness. The ability to
                                stay out of the
                                story, zoom back, and see new pathways into and around a challenge will be of boundless
                                use.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If we allow this principle to work on us as we work on it, our imagination frees us from
                                the web of
                                personal and cultural stories engulfing us. Art has the power to snap us out of our
                                transfixion, open
                                our minds to what’s possible, and reconnect with the eternal energy that moves through
                                all things.
