                        <p>There are no shortcuts.
                                <br>

                                The lottery winner isn’t ultimately happy after their sudden change of fortune. The home
                                built hastily
                                rarely survives the first storm. The single-sentence summary of a book or news event is
                                no substitute
                                for the full story.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We often take shortcuts without knowing it. When listening, we tend to skip forward and
                                generalize the
                                speaker’s overall message. We miss the subtleties of the point, if not the entire
                                premise. In addition
                                to the assumption that we are saving time, this shortcut also avoids the discomfort of
                                challenging our
                                prevailing stories. And our worldview continues to shrink.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The artist actively works to experience life slowly, and then to re-experience the same
                                thing anew. To
                                read slowly, and to read and read again.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I might read a paragraph that inspires a thought, and while my eyes continue moving
                                across the page in
                                the physical act of reading, my mind may still be lost in the previous idea. I’m not
                                taking in
                                information anymore. When I realize this, I return to the last paragraph I can recall
                                and start reading
                                from there again. Sometimes it’s three or four pages back.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Re-reading even a well-understood paragraph or page can be revelatory. New meanings,
                                deeper
                                understandings, inspirations, and nuances arise and come into focus.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Reading, in addition to listening, eating, and most physical activities, can be
                                experienced like
                                driving: we can participate either on autopilot or with focused intention. So often we
                                sleepwalk through
                                our lives. Consider how different your experience of the world might be if you engaged
                                in every activity
                                with the attention you might give to landing a plane.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There are those who approach the opportunities of each day like crossing items off a
                                to-do list instead
                                of truly engaging and participating with all of themselves.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Our continual quest for efficiency discourages looking too deeply. The pressure to
                                deliver doesn’t grant
                                us time to consider all possibilities. Yet it’s through deliberate action and repetition
                                that we gain
                                deeper insight.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Patience is required for the nuanced development of your craft.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Patience is required for taking in information in the most faithful way possible.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Patience is required for crafting a work that resonates and contains all that we have to
                                offer.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Every phase of an artist’s work and life benefits from cultivating this achievable
                                habit.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Patience is developed much like awareness. Through an acceptance of what is. Impatience
                                is an argument
                                with reality. The desire for something to be different from what we are experiencing in
                                the here and
                                now. A wish for time to speed up, tomorrow to come sooner, to relive yesterday, or to
                                close your eyes
                                then open them and find yourself in another place.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Time is something that we have no control over. So patience begins with acceptance of
                                natural rhythms.
                                The implied benefit of impatience is to save time by speeding up and skipping ahead of
                                those rhythms.
                                Paradoxically, this ends up taking more time and using more energy. It’s wasted effort.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When it comes to the creative process, patience is accepting that the majority of the
                                work we do is out
                                of our control. We can’t force greatness to happen. All we can do is invite it in and
                                await it actively.
                                Not anxiously, as this might scare it off. Simply in a state of continual welcoming.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If we remove time from the equation of a work’s development, what we’re left with is
                                patience. Not just
                                for the development of the work, but for the development of the artist as a whole. Even
                                the masterpieces
                                that have been produced on tight timelines are the sum of decades spent patiently
                                laboring on other
                                works.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If there is a rule to creativity that’s less breakable than the others, it’s that the
                                need for patience
                                is ever-present.
