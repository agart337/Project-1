                        <br>
                        <p>When listening, there is only now. In Buddhist practice, a bell is rung as part of the
                                ritual. The sound
                                instantly pulls the participant into the present moment. It’s a small reminder to wake
                                up.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                While the eyes and the mouth can be sealed, an ear has no lid, nothing to close. It
                                takes in what
                                surrounds it. It receives but can’t transmit.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The ear is simply present to the world.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When we hear, sounds enter the ear autonomously. Often, we’re not aware of all the
                                individual sounds and
                                their full range.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Listening is paying attention to those sounds, being present with them, being in
                                communion with them.
                                Though to say that we listen with the ears, or the mind, might be a misconception. We
                                listen with the
                                whole body, our whole self.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The vibrations filling the space around us, the act of sound waves hitting the body, the
                                spatial
                                perceptions they indicate, the internal physical reactions they stimulate—this is all
                                part of listening.
                                Certain bass sounds can be felt only in the body, they can’t be perceived by the ears.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The difference can be noticed when listening to music through headphones instead of
                                speakers.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Headphones create an illusion, tricking your senses into believing you are hearing
                                everything the music
                                is offering. Many artists refuse to use headphones in the studio as it is a poor replica
                                of the
                                real-world listening experience. With speakers, we are closer to the sound of
                                instruments in the
                                room—immersed physically in a full sonic spectrum of vibration.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Many of us experience life as if we’re taking it in through a pair of headphones. We
                                strip away the full
                                register. We hear information, but don’t detect the subtler vibrations of feeling in the
                                body.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When you practice listening with the whole self, you expand the scope of your
                                consciousness to include
                                vast amounts of information otherwise missed, and discover more material to feed your
                                art habit.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If it’s music you’re listening to, consider closing your eyes. You may find yourself
                                getting lost in the
                                experience. When the piece ends, you might be surprised by where you find yourself.
                                You’ve been
                                transported to another place. The place where the music lives.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Communication moves in two directions, even when one person speaks and another listens
                                silently.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When the listener is totally present, the speaker often communicates differently. Most
                                people aren’t
                                used to being fully heard, and it can be jarring for them.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Sometimes we block the flow of information being offered and compromise true listening.
                                Our critical
                                mind may kick in, taking note of what we agree with and what we don’t, or what we like
                                and dislike. We
                                may look for reasons to distrust the speaker or make them wrong.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Formulating an opinion is not listening. Neither is preparing a response, or defending
                                our position or
                                attacking another’s. To listen impatiently is to hear nothing at all.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Listening is suspending disbelief.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We are openly receiving. Paying attention with no preconceived ideas. The only goal is
                                to fully and
                                clearly understand what is being transmitted, remaining totally present with what’s
                                being expressed—and
                                allowing it to be what it is.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                defending a story in your own head, you miss information that might alter or evolve your
                                current
                                thoughts.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If we can go beyond our reflexive response, we may find there is something more beneath
                                that resonates
                                with us or helps our understanding. The new information might reinforce an idea,
                                slightly alter it, or
                                completely reverse it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Listening without prejudice is how we grow and learn as people. More often than not,
                                there are no right
                                answers, just different perspectives. The more perspectives we can learn to see, the
                                greater our
                                understanding becomes. Our filter can begin to more accurately approach what truly is,
                                rather than a
                                narrow sliver interpreted through our bias.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Regardless of the type of art you’re making, listening opens possibilities. It allows
                                you to see a
                                bigger world. Many of our beliefs were learned before we had a choice in what we were
                                taught. Some of
                                them might go back generations and may no longer apply. Some may never have applied.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Listening, then, is not just awareness. It’s freedom from accepted limitations.
