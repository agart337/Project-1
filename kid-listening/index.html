                When you listen, you are in the present moment. In Buddhist practice, a bell is rung to remind people to
                wake up and be aware.
                <br>
                <br>
                Your ears are always open. They take in sounds without needing to do anything. When you listen, you
                don’t just hear—you feel the sounds in your whole body. Deep sounds, like bass, can be felt more than
                heard.
                <br>
                <br>
                Listening through headphones is different from listening to real sounds in a room. Headphones can trick
                you into thinking you hear everything, but real sounds surround you and can be felt. Many musicians
                prefer speakers because they give a fuller sound experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                In life, we sometimes only hear the surface of things, like listening through headphones. But true
                listening means paying attention to everything, not just the obvious sounds or words.
                <br>
                <br>
                Good listening also helps with talking. When someone knows you are really listening, they speak
                differently. Many people aren’t used to being fully heard. But if we only listen to reply or judge, we
                aren’t really listening.
                <br>
                <br>
                Listening means being open. It’s not about agreeing or disagreeing—it’s about understanding. When we
                listen without judgment, we can learn new things and grow.
                <br>
                <br>
                Listening helps us see the world in a bigger way. It can change what we believe and free us from old
                ideas that no longer fit. True listening isn’t just about sound—it’s about being open to new
                possibilities.
