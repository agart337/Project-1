            <p>
                Inspiration appears in an instant, like a sudden spark of light. It fuels creativity and feels like a
                gift from the universe.
                <br>
                <br>
                The word comes from Latin, meaning "to breathe in." Just like our lungs need to empty before taking in
                fresh air, our minds need space to welcome new ideas. If we are too full—of thoughts, distractions, or
                even old beliefs—there is no room for something new.
                <br>
                <br>
                To invite inspiration, we can quiet our minds through meditation, silence, or deep breathing. While this
                doesn’t guarantee inspiration, it creates space for it to arrive. Inspiration feels like a burst of
                energy, but we can’t wait around for it. Creativity also requires effort and practice.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ideas can come from everyday moments—a shadow, a smell, a misheard phrase. To find new inspiration, try
                changing how you experience things: watch a movie without sound, listen to a song on repeat, or notice
                patterns in nature.
                <br>
                <br>
                One sign of inspiration is awe. We often forget how amazing the world is. If we look with fresh eyes, we
                can find wonder in even the simplest things. This sense of beauty can guide our own creative work.
                <br>
                <br>
                When inspiration comes, stay with it. If ideas are flowing, don’t stop—keep going as long as you can.
                Even if the work isn’t perfect, capturing the full idea is more valuable than having just a small,
                polished piece.
                <br>
                <br>
                John Lennon once said that if you start writing a song, finish it in one sitting. The first spark has a
                special energy that can carry you through. If you step away, it may fade and be hard to get back.
                Inspiration is like a wave—ride it while it lasts.
