                        designer. By engaging with code as a design medium, Marie examines the embedded assumptions
                        behind
                        technology and explores the expressive capacity of “use.” She teaches typography-focused web
                        courses, and has presented on sustainable, context-driven websites at conferences globally. Her
                        work
