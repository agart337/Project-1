                        <p>It appears in a moment.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                An immaculate conception.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                A divine flash of light. An idea that would otherwise require labor to unfold suddenly
                                blooms in a
                                single inhalation.
                                What defines inspiration is the quality and quantity of the download. At a speed so
                                instantaneous, it
                                seems impossible to process. Inspiration is the rocket fuel powering our work. It is a
                                universal
                                conversation we yearn to be part of.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The word comes from the Latin—inspirare, meaning to breathe in or blow into.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                For the lungs to draw in air, they must first be emptied. For the mind to draw
                                inspiration, it wants
                                space to welcome the new. The universe seeks balance. Through this absence, you are
                                inviting energy in.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The same principle applies to everything in life. If we are looking for a relationship
                                when we’re
                                already in one, then we are full. There is no room for the new to enter. And we are
                                unable to welcome in
                                the relationship we want.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To create space for inspiration, we might consider practices of quieting the mind:
                                meditation,
                                awareness, silence, contemplation, prayer, any ritual that helps us fend off distraction
                                and papancha.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Breath itself is a potent vehicle to calm our thoughts, create space, and tune in. It
                                cannot guarantee
                                that inspiration will come, though the vacancy may draw the muse in to play.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Taken more spiritually, inspiration means to breathe life into. An ancient
                                interpretation defines it as
                                the immediate influence of the divine. For the artist, inspiration is a breath of
                                creative force drawn
                                in instantly from outside of our small selves. We can’t be sure where this spark of
                                insight originates.
                                It’s helpful to know it’s not us alone.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When inspiration does arrive, it is invariably energizing. But it is not something to
                                rely on. An
                                artistic life cannot be built solely around waiting. Inspiration is out of our control
                                and can prove
                                hard to find. Effort is required and invitations are to be extended. In its absence, we
                                may work on
                                other areas of the project independent of this cosmic transmission.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Epiphanies are hidden in the most ordinary of moments: the casting of a shadow, the
                                smell of a match
                                igniting, an unusual phrase overheard or misheard. A dedication to the practice of
                                showing up on a
                                regular basis is the main requirement.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To vary your inspiration, consider varying your inputs. Turn the sound off to watch a
                                film, listen to
                                the same song on repeat, read only the first word of each sentence in a short story,
                                arrange stones by
                                size or color, learn to lucid dream.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Break habits.<br>
                                Look for differences.<br>
                                Notice connections.<br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                One indicator of inspiration is awe. We tend to take so much for granted. How can we
                                move past
                                disconnection and desensitization to the incredible wonders of nature and human
                                engineering all around
                                us?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Most of what we see in the world holds the potential to inspire astonishment if looked
                                at from a less
                                jaded perspective. Train yourself to see the awe behind the obvious. Look at the world
                                from this vantage
                                point as often as possible. Submerge yourself.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The beauty around us enriches our lives in so many ways. It is an end in itself. And it
                                sets an example
                                for our own work. We can aim to develop an eye for harmony and balance, as if our
                                creations have always
                                been here, like mountains or feathers.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Ride the wave as long as it can be ridden. If you are fortunate enough to experience the
                                strike of
                                inspiration, take full advantage of the access. Remain in the energy of this rarefied
                                moment for as long
                                as it lasts. When flowing, keep going.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you’re a writer and you tap into a stream of ideas before bed, you may want to stay
                                with it until
                                dawn. If you’re a musician and you’ve reached your goal of creating one song or ten
                                songs, yet the music
                                is still coming, capture all you can.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The work yielded may not be used in the current project, but it may be of use another
                                time. Or it may
                                not. The task of the artist is simply to recognize the transmission and stay with it in
                                gratitude, until
                                it truly runs its course.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In terms of priority, inspiration comes first. You come next. The audience comes last.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                These are special moments and are to be treated with the utmost devotion. Our schedules
                                are set aside
                                when these fleeting moments of illumination come. Summon your strength and commit
                                yourself on behalf of
                                this offering, even when it arises at an inopportune time. This is the serious artist’s
                                obligation.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                John Lennon once advised that if you start a song, write it through to the end in that
                                sitting. The
                                initial inspiration has a vitality in it that can carry you through the whole piece.
                                Don’t be concerned
                                if some of the parts are not yet all they can be. Get through a rough draft. A full,
                                imperfect version
                                is generally more helpful than a seemingly perfect fragment.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When an idea forms, or a hook is written, we may feel that we’ve cracked the code and
                                the rest will take
                                care of itself. If we step away and let that initial spark fade, we may return to find
                                it’s not so easy
                                to rekindle. Think of inspiration as a force not immune to the laws of entropy.
